  "summary": "Diff adds a React Three Fiber-based 3D viewer to DungeonPage with WebGL support detection, hotspot markers for quests/crates, and click-to-select + scroll behavior. However, the implementation appears to use procedural geometry (floor/walls) and does not show any added static 3D model assets being loaded, so the “dungeon model asset(s) as static frontend assets” requirement is not evidenced.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-68",
      "requirement": "Add the required 3D asset(s) for the dungeon model as static frontend assets (no backend serving) and load them from the Dungeons page 3D scene.",
      "reason": "No 3D asset files (e.g., .glb/.gltf/textures) are added in the diff summary, and the 3D scene shown is built from basic primitives (plane/box) rather than loading a dungeon model from static frontend assets. While a loading overlay exists, there is no evidence of an asset loader (e.g., useGLTF) or static asset path usage.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest asks to embed the 3D viewer above the lists, but does not request a user-toggle to show/hide the viewer. The diff shows `show3DViewer` state, implying additional UI/behavior beyond the requested requirements.",
