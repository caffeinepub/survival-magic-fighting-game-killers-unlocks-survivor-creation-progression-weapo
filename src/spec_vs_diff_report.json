Backend changes for adding 9 new killers to unlockNextKiller() and adding 26 new dungeon quests cannot be verified from the provided truncated backend diff summary, so those requirements are treated as missing/unsupported by evidence. Additionally, unrequested documentation/state summary files were modified.",
